										<h2> I've learned a lot in this course. Here is what I have to say about Writing and Digital Media: </h2>
									</header>


									<p>I know next to nothing about digital media. But there’s a bright side! Everything we’ve been learning up to this point as been new and exciting.
</p>


<p> Naturally, I would not consider myself a super tech-savvy human. Neither would my roommates, who I am always asking for help trying to navigate seemingly simple computer-related tasks such navigating word documents or installing printers. I originally did not have fantastic feelings about HTML, and was intimidated. Understand more of what goes into the websites I use every day has been humbling. There is a lot more that goes into the internet than I would have originally assumed. I am still far from an HTML master, or even being comfortable with it for that matter. However, am starting to recognize the patterns that seem to occur in HTML. I am a little impressed that I can ever begin to comprehend it slightly. At the beginning of my complicated relationship with HTML, many of the patterns failed to “click” for me. I spent a lot of time looking up how to do the same things, over and over again. However, a little (a lot) of trial and error, some elements seem to make sense! </p>

 <p> As I mentioned earlier, I would not consider myself super tech-savvy. My nature prevents me from jumping up and down about anything with the word “digital” in the course description. However, my experience thus far in the course has been positive! I am more confident in my HTML skills (which were previously non-existent), and I have come to appreciate the role of digital writing much more. In a technical era, it seems vital to have the skills to write and edit digitally in order to be productive (and get a job some day!). I am way more interested in this class than I thought I’d be. The relationship between the framework of websites and the actual content is something that I have never considered or explored.    </p>

										<p>Here’s what I’ve gotten from the the VT-shaped model: Our world is becoming multifaceted, and in order to “keep up” we must make ourselves as interdisciplinary as possible. However, this does not suggest that we must be all be English language experts and scientists and accountants all at the same time. As engineers or as english students, we need each other. In order to be successful and make the most out of our time and our careers, it’s important to know when to ask for help. Cue  <b> CollaborationSpace! </b>

											<p> CollaborationSpace is a website/app that I have proposed in response to the VT-shaped model for this final. It is largely based the idea of TimeBanks. If you haven’t heard it of the TimeBank before, it a Craigslist–esq service that connects people who have skills (for example, shelf-building) to people that need assistance (for example, someone who needs a shelf built). The website connects the two, and the shelf-builder is paid with “hours” that the other person as accumulated from providing a service or skills to someone else.

											<h3> Home Page </h3>
										</header>
										<p>This is the homepage of the website and of the app. After the user logs into their account, they can see all of the projects rejects that are currently available, with a short name and description. This looks similar to any other online shopping website. In order to learn more about the project, users can simply click on it.

											<h3> Project Details </h3>
										</header>
										<p>This brings them to the project details page. Here, the user can find out more about what the project entails: what needs to be done, how long it is expected to take, etc. Here the user can message other users and ask questions, agree on parameters of the project, and commit to help one another.

											<h3> My Profile </h3>
										</header>
										<p>Before a user accepts help, they can view other’s profiles. Each user’s profile details the user’s skills, past projects, reviews from other users, and picture. This allows the user to get to know the other’s skills a little bit before they begin working together.
</p>


<p> I believe that this website helps address the VT-shaped model in that is allows members of the Virginia Tech community to use their skills to help others out. This not only allows students to practice their editing, or engineering skills in practical, low-pressure ways, but students working together to produce better products strengthen the community and simulate real-world collaboration.
