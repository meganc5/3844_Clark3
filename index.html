									<p>I know next to nothing about digital media. But there’s a bright side! Everything we’ve been learning up to this point as been new and exciting.
</p>
										<p> I found some of the last reading on copyright particularly interesting. While the general concept of copyright is not entirely new to me, I never considered copyrights’ implications before this reading. The length of copyright becomes really significant when we talk about access. Free Culture spoke about copyright, “Thus, most of the content from the nineteenth century was free for Disney to use and build upon in 1928. It was free for anyone— whether connected or not, whether rich or not, whether approved or not—to use and build upon." I’ve used this quotation a couple of times in the class (for the second response, and again on the website remix assignment) because it has stood out to me. With shifting copyright laws, it seems that creativity can in some extents be oppressed in the name of profit. As the quote above mentions, those who have connections, wealth, and approval have more creative opportunities and access than not. While this may be more profitable, it seems that it stunts creativity to some extent.

</p>

<p> Naturally, I would not consider myself a super tech-savvy human. Neither would my roommates, who I am always asking for help trying to navigate seemingly simple computer-related tasks such navigating word documents or installing printers. I originally did not have fantastic feelings about HTML, and was intimidated. Understand more of what goes into the websites I use every day has been humbling. There is a lot more that goes into the internet than I would have originally assumed. I am still far from an HTML master, or even being comfortable with it for that matter. However, am starting to recognize the patterns that seem to occur in HTML. I am a little impressed that I can ever begin to comprehend it slightly. At the beginning of my complicated relationship with HTML, many of the patterns failed to “click” for me. I spent a lot of time looking up how to do the same things, over and over again. However, a little (a lot) of trial and error, some elements seem to make sense! </p>

 <p> As I mentioned earlier, I would not consider myself super tech-savvy. My nature prevents me from jumping up and down about anything with the word “digital” in the course description. However, my experience thus far in the course has been positive! I am more confident in my HTML skills (which were previously non-existent), and I have come to appreciate the role of digital writing much more. In a technical era, it seems vital to have the skills to write and edit digitally in order to be productive (and get a job some day!). I am way more interested in this class than I thought I’d be. The relationship between the framework of websites and the actual content is something that I have never considered or explored. While this class and what we have learned about digital media so far as truly made me more interested and appreciative, I think I will end this reflection with a little story: </p>

  <p>  I went home to visit my folks last weekend, and being the “geek” I am now, I was excited to show my parents what I have been working on in class. However, they were seemingly unimpressed. My little sister (age 10) is in a coding club at her elementary school and has been working on HTML much longer than I have. Sigh. Now, fueled by a competitive spirt and unhealthy sibling rivalry, I am looking forward to progressing in this class and learning more about digital writing.
</p>

<p> Below, are some of my <b> interests: </b.

Two resounding themes of this effort are dynamism and agility—characteristics not often used to describe higher education institutions in the traditional context." - <i> Beyond Boundaries </i> </p> 									</section>

<p> “We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands. “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).” - <i> VT-Shaped Student </i> </p>

<p> "Ours was a free culture. It is becoming much less so." <i> Free Culture </i> page 44 </p>

<p>The VT-shaped graduate will be well-rounded, both hirable and ready to serve the community, Rikakis said.- "Virginia Tech's provost orchestrating change" </p>

										<p> "This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a function of both the words on the books and the costs of making those words have effect." - <i> Free Culture </i> page 27 </p>
<p>“I’m really excited by the degree to which Thanassis Rikakis has taken ideas… of taking down boundaries,” Sands said. “With Thanassis’ leadership, we’re going into an area that’s more 21st century than 20th century." - Virginia Tech's provost orchestrating change </p>
<p> "Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for content from before the Great Depression." - Free Culture page 39 </p>
