										<h2> I've learned a lot in this course. Here is what I have to say about Writing and Digital Media: </h2>
									</header>


									<p>I know next to nothing about digital media. But there’s a bright side! Everything we’ve been learning up to this point as been new and exciting.
</p>


<p> Naturally, I would not consider myself a super tech-savvy human. Neither would my roommates, who I am always asking for help trying to navigate seemingly simple computer-related tasks such navigating word documents or installing printers. I originally did not have fantastic feelings about HTML, and was intimidated. Understand more of what goes into the websites I use every day has been humbling. There is a lot more that goes into the internet than I would have originally assumed. I am still far from an HTML master, or even being comfortable with it for that matter. However, am starting to recognize the patterns that seem to occur in HTML. I am a little impressed that I can ever begin to comprehend it slightly. At the beginning of my complicated relationship with HTML, many of the patterns failed to “click” for me. I spent a lot of time looking up how to do the same things, over and over again. However, a little (a lot) of trial and error, some elements seem to make sense! </p>

 <p> As I mentioned earlier, I would not consider myself super tech-savvy. My nature prevents me from jumping up and down about anything with the word “digital” in the course description. However, my experience thus far in the course has been positive! I am more confident in my HTML skills (which were previously non-existent), and I have come to appreciate the role of digital writing much more. In a technical era, it seems vital to have the skills to write and edit digitally in order to be productive (and get a job some day!). I am way more interested in this class than I thought I’d be. The relationship between the framework of websites and the actual content is something that I have never considered or explored.    </p>

											<h3> Putting the "V" with the "T" </h3>
										</header>
										<p>Here’s what I’ve gotten from the the VT-shaped model: Our world is becoming multifaceted, and in order to “keep up” we must make ourselves as interdisciplinary as possible. However, this does not suggest that we must be all be English language experts and scientists and accountants all at the same time. As engineers or as english students, we need each other. In order to be successful and make the most out of our time and our careers, it’s important to know when to ask for help. Cue  <b> CollaborationSpace! </b>

									<p>"It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail." - <i> As We May Think </i> Vannevar Bush </p>

<p> "Through these concepts, Virginia Tech is poised to confront the changing future. Two resounding themes of this effort are dynamism and agility—characteristics not often used to describe higher education institutions in the traditional context." - <i> Beyond Boundaries </i> </p> 									</section>

<p> “We want to prepare students who can tackle the complex global problems and opportunities of the future,” said President Tim Sands. “To do that, students need to be adaptable, resilient, and culturally competent, seeing the world through the lens of empathy and our university’s motto, Ut Prosim (That I May Serve).” - <i> VT-Shaped Student </i> </p>

										<p>"We should work toward a universal linked information system, in which generality and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities." - <i> Information Management: A Proposal</i>, Tim Berners-Lee</p>

<p> "Ours was a free culture. It is becoming much less so." <i> Free Culture </i> page 44 </p>

<p>The VT-shaped graduate will be well-rounded, both hirable and ready to serve the community, Rikakis said.- "Virginia Tech's provost orchestrating change" </p>





										<p>"Thus, most of the content from the nineteenth century was free for Disney to use and build upon in 1928. It was free for anyone— whether connected or not, whether rich or not, whether approved or not—to use and build upon." - <i>Free Culture </i> page 38</p>

										<p> "This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a function of both the words on the books and the costs of making those words have effect." - <i> Free Culture </i> page 27 </p>
<p>“I’m really excited by the degree to which Thanassis Rikakis has taken ideas… of taking down boundaries,” Sands said. “With Thanassis’ leadership, we’re going into an area that’s more 21st century than 20th century." - Virginia Tech's provost orchestrating change </p>
<p> "Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for content from before the Great Depression." - Free Culture page 39 </p>
